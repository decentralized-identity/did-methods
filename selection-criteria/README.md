# DID method selection criteria

This file contains a list of selection criteria for standardizing an initial set of DID methods.
This is one of the activities of the DID Methods WG as described in its [Charter](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/main/Org%20documents/WG%20documents/DIF_DID_Methods_WG_Charter_v1.pdf).

## Criteria

of the 4th Dec 2024 WG meeting with a summary of selection criteria proposed by the community.
