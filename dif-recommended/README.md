# DIF-recommended DID Methods

This page describes a process for DID methods to achieve a status of "DIF-recommended DID Method", which is
intended to be a label for DID methods that comply with DIF's published evaluation criteria and have passed the review process.

Note: All DID methods must pass all requirements in the process in order to be considered "DIF-recommended",
irrespective of where they are being developed and standardized.

The following table tracks DID methods that are currently participating in this process.

(1) Use alphabetical order.

(2) Must be some kind of final version, include link to specification.

(3) See https://www.w3.org/TR/did-extensions-methods/.

(4) Include link to proposal file at https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-methods/tree/main/method-proposals.

(5) Include link to W3C test suite data at https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/tree/main/packages/did-core-test-server/suites/implementations.

(6) See https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver.

(7) See https://identity.foundation/did-traits/.

(8) Include link to meeting recording/notes, e.g., at https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-methods/blob/main/AGENDA.md. Deep
dives can be scheduled multiple times per DID method depending on maturity and open issues, and can be held in any
working group or meeting at DIF or associated groups (W3C CCG, ToIP, etc.).

(9) Include proof of multiple implementations, could be in the proposal file at (4).

(10) Include proof of significant deployment, could be in the proposal file at (4).

(11) Include link to ongoing standardization process, or link to final document once the standardization target
has been reached.

(12) DID method becomes "DIF-recommended" after DIF Technical Steering Committee confirms that all requirements have been met.
