# DIF-recommended DID Methods

This page describes a process for DID methods to achieve a status of "DIF-recommended DID Method", which is intended to be a label for DID methods that comply with DIF's published evaluation criteria and have passed the review process.

The process is as follows:

1. The method advocate submits the DID method for consideration by creating a Pull Request with a [DID method recommendation proposals](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-methods/blob/main/method-proposals/). The proposed DID method may or may not be a DIF work item (in the former case, the usual [Work Item Life Cycle](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/main/work-item-lifecycle.md) applies).
1. The advocate presents the proposal template contents during a working group meeting and receives initial feedback.
1. When the method meets the criteria outlined in the table below, the advocate schedules the first deep dive with the working group chairs during a regular meeting.
1. The first deep dive occurs, where the group provides detailed feedback on the method's maturity and compliance with requirements.
1. The advocate addresses any concerns raised before scheduling the second deep dive with the chairs. The second deep dive must occur at least two weeks after the first.
1. The second deep dive takes place. Duration varies based on remaining concerns and new issues raised.
1. After the second deep dive, the working group chairs submit a PR changing the "DIF Recommended" column from 'no' to 'yes', signaling the start of the formal review period.
1. The working group chair(s) notify the DIF Executive Director that the method's formal review period has started, to initiate the DIF Steering Committee review process.
1. The 60-day formal review period begins immediately after the second deep dive and is announced publicly via relevant DIF mailing lists.
1. During the formal review period, all questions or concerns must be addressed through PR comments. Active discussion is expected for each method.
1. During the formal review period, the DIF Steering Committee can meet and approve or reject the DIF Recommended Status. If the DIF Steering Committee does not act within this period, it is considered to have approved the status.
1. During the formal review period, the DID Methods WG produces a "findings" document which summarizes the steps that have been taken in this process, as documentation for justifying the DIF Recommended Status. This "findings document" should be created by neutral WG members with no particular affiliation to the proposed DID method.
1. If no outstanding questions, concerns, or objections remain at the end of the formal review period, the chairs merge the PR and the method attains DIF Recommended Status.

The following table tracks DID methods that are currently participating in this process.

## Column Definitions

1. **Method**: DID Method Name (sorted by DIF Recommended status, then alphabetically)
1. **DIF Recommended**: DIF-recommended DID Method (DID method becomes "DIF-recommended" after DIF Technical Steering Committee confirms that all requirements have been met)
1. **Spec Version**: DID Method Spec Version (must be some kind of final version, include link to specification)
1. **W3C Registry**: Registered in W3C Methods Registry (see <https://www.w3.org/TR/did-extensions-methods/>)
1. **Proposal**: Method Proposal Template (include link to proposal file at <https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-methods/tree/main/method-proposals>)
1. **W3C Tests**: Passed W3C Test suite (include link to W3C test suite data at <https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/tree/main/packages/did-core-test-server/suites/implementations>)
