# DID method standardization proposal: did:mdip

This is a proposal to include `did:mdip` to the set of DID methods recognized and recommended by the WIF DID Methods WG.

## Description

The Internet needs an identity layer. MDIP was envisioned as a tokenless, network agnostic, and fully decentralized identity protocol for the Internet. MDIP offers a user-centric model of identity where user agents can collect and assert claims, in a fully peer-to-peer fashion, with other user agents. 

The MDIP (MultiDimensional Identity Protocol) DID method specification conforms to the requirements specified in the [DID specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) currently published by the W3C Credentials Community Group. The MDIP DID method (`did:mdip`) is designed to support a P2P identity layer with secure decentralized [verifiable credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/). MDIP DIDs are used for agents (e.g., users, issuers, verifiers, and MDIP nodes) and assets (e.g., verifiable credentials, verifiable presentations, schemas, challenges, and responses).

### DID Lifecycle

![did-lifecycle.png](https://github.com/KeychainMDIP/kc/blob/main/doc/mdip/did-lifecycle.png)

All MDIP DIDs begin life anchored to a CAS (Content-Addressable Storage) such as IPFS. Once created they can be used immediately by any application or service connected to an MDIP node. Subsequent updates to the DID (meaning that a document associated with the DID changes) are registered on a registry such as a blockchain (BTC, ETH, etc) or a decentralized database (e.g. hyperswarm). The registry is specified at DID creation so that nodes can determine which single source of truth to check for updates.

The *key concept of this design* is that MDIP DID creation is decentralized through through the CAS, and DID updates are decentralized through the registry specified in the DID creation. The MDIP DID is decentralized for its whole lifecycle, which is a hard requirement of DIDs.

## Overview
The diagram below illustrates the components that form a full Keychain MDIP Node. Additional details and quick start instructions are available in the repository.

### Gatekeeper: 
A Keychain MDIP node includes several interoperating microservices. If you follow the dependency arrows on the diagram above, you will end up at the central core service, the [Gatekeeper service](https://github.com/KeychainMDIP/kc/blob/main/services/gatekeeper/server/README.md) responsible for maintaining the integrity of the local DID database. 

### Mediators: 
The mediators are responsible for connecting the Gatekeeper to various networks such as [Hyperswarm](https://github.com/KeychainMDIP/kc/blob/main/services/mediators/hyperswarm/README.md). The TBTC (testnet Bitcoin) and TFTC (testnet Feathercoin) mediators are both instances of the [Satoshi mediator](https://github.com/KeychainMDIP/kc/blob/main/services/mediators/satoshi/README.md) since they are derived from Bitcoin core (they differ only in how they are configured). 

### Keymaster: 
[Keymaster](https://github.com/KeychainMDIP/kc/blob/main/packages/keymaster/README.md) is the MDIP client responsible for holding the private keys and signing DID operations (create, update, delete) sent to Gatekeeper. 

### Wallets: 
The [browser web wallet](https://github.com/KeychainMDIP/kc/blob/main/services/gatekeeper/client/README.md), [browser extension](https://github.com/KeychainMDIP/kc/blob/main/browser/chrome-extension/README.md), and [Keymaster service](https://github.com/KeychainMDIP/kc/blob/main/services/keymaster/server/README.md) all use the [Keymaster library](https://github.com/KeychainMDIP/kc/blob/main/packages/keymaster/README.md). The [server web wallet](https://github.com/KeychainMDIP/kc/blob/main/services/keymaster/client/README.md) is the same as the browser web wallet, except it is configured to talk to the Keymaster service instead of hosting its own wallet. It uses the same [KeymasterClient](https://github.com/KeychainMDIP/kc/blob/main/packages/keymaster/src/keymaster-sdk.ts) as the kc CLI. 

### DID Explorer: 
The [explorer](https://github.com/KeychainMDIP/kc/blob/main/services/explorer/README.md) and [search-server](https://github.com/KeychainMDIP/kc/blob/main/services/search-server/README.md) provide DID resolution, search and general interaction with DIDs and DID Documents.

### CLI: 
There are two CLI (command line interface) components: [kc](https://github.com/KeychainMDIP/kc/blob/main/scripts/keychain-cli.js) for talking to the Keymaster service, and [admin](https://github.com/KeychainMDIP/kc/blob/main/scripts/admin-cli.js) for talking to the Gatekeeper service. The admin script uses the same [GatekeeperClient](https://github.com/KeychainMDIP/kc/blob/main/packages/gatekeeper/README.md) as the Keymaster service and the mediators.

### Authentication Demo: 
A reference MDIP-enabled client application that demonstrates the challenge/response based authentication process. The demo also establishes privileged groups of users categorized as members, moderators, admins, or owner. [MDIP auth-demo repository](https://github.com/KeychainMDIP/auth-demo)

## Meeting the selection criteria

Document here how this DID method meets the [DID method selection criteria](../selection-criteria/).

| **Criteria** | **Details** |
|----------|----------|
| **Alignment with DID Core specification** | [Yes](https://github.com/KeychainMDIP/kc/blob/main/doc/mdip/scheme.md) |
| **Security and privacy features** | [Yes](https://github.com/KeychainMDIP/kc/tree/main/packages/cipher) |
| **Scalability and performance** | Yes. MDIP has a [modular architecture](https://github.com/KeychainMDIP/kc/blob/main/keychain-node.png) that enables scalable deployments. |
| **Ease of implementation and use** | Yes. See our [quick start](https://github.com/KeychainMDIP/kc/blob/main/README.md) instructions for easy Docker deployment. |
| **Community adoption and support** | Early Stages. This is one of our objectives in engaging with the DIF. |
| **Compliance with relevant regulations and best practices** | Yes. Another good reason for MDIP to register with the DIF. |
| **Global government-approved crypto** | Yes. MDIP uses [commonly reputed best practice crypto libraries](https://github.com/KeychainMDIP/kc/tree/main/packages/cipher). |
| **Privacy-preserving crypto** | Yes. Users generate their key-pairs on local devices. |
| **Digitally signed cryptographic log of changes to the DID Document** | Yes. Each Gatekeeper re-validates each DIDs by [applying DID Document changes one-by-one](https://github.com/KeychainMDIP/kc/blob/main/doc/mdip/did-lifecycle.png) in their proper order of registration. |
| **Multi-factor binding to DNS** | No. |
| **Specification with multiple implementers** | No. We are looking forward to multiple implementations and SDKs in other languages. |
| **Scope/domain of the types of entities/subjects addressed/named by a particular method** | MDIP can be used in both public and private applications. |
| **Estimate of the daily transaction volume of each scope/domain** | The MDIP network currently resolves ~15K DIDs. The network is mainly used by SelfID.com developers. |
| **DID Methods that do not serve the needs of a particular company or government** | Development of MDIP is financed by SelfID.com |
| **Governance: Clear frameworks for updates, dispute resolution, and decision-making** | An OSS-friendly governance model is being prepared but has not been launched yet. |
| **Usability: Simple implementation for developers** | A full MDIP node can be installed and launched within minutes using the [quick-start](https://github.com/KeychainMDIP/kc/blob/main/README.md) Docker deployment. |
| **Sustainability: Energy efficiency and eco-friendly infrastructure** | A full MDIP node can be operated on a simple RaspberryPi with 4Gb of RAM. |
| **Economic Feasibility: DIDs costs of use must be reasonable** | DID operations are free. Optional with-fee blockchain registration can be batched to manage costs. |
| **Legal Recognition: Cross-border frameworks for DID acceptance** | N/A |
| **Revocation and Recovery: Decentralized mechanisms for key rotation and DID recovery** | The MDIP Keymaster wallet uses Bip-39 HD Keys. Each Agent DID in the wallet receives its own keypair that can be rotated. |
| **Emerging Markets: Offline-friendly, low-bandwidth** | Yes. MDIP can operate on low-power devices. Gatekeeper DID resolution functionality remains available to local users when disconnected from the global networks. |
| **Long-lived DIDs needed for long-lived VCs** | Yes. MDIP can evidence DIDs and VCs on a plurality of registries. |
| **Low and predictable marginal cost at scale (millions of accounts)** | TBD |
| **Ability to create and update identifiers rapidly (within seconds)** | Yes. MDIP operations are distributed to a public Hyperswarm channel within seconds, fast enough for user authentication scenarios. |
| **Support for key rotation** | Yes. MDIP provides key rotation functionality for each individual DID.  |
| **Reliable and predictable-latency operation, for updating and resolving** | The MDIP Gatekeeper operates its own indexed DB; supported DBs include: sqlite, redis, mongodb and json file.  |
| **Resolution should not require additional state or context** | Each MDIP Gatekeeper operates independently and manages its current view of the network in a local database. |
| **DIDs are permanent and immutable account identifiers** | Yes. |
| **Consider support for various DID Traits: <https://identity.foundation/did-traits/>** | TBD |
| **Consider categories defined by DID Rubric: <https://www.w3.org/TR/did-rubric/>** | TBD |
| **Who WANTS to standardize the DID method and commits to doing the work?** | Keychain MDIP development is managed and financed by [Selfid.com](https://selfid.com), a brainchild and business lead and operated by [Craig Sellars](https://www.linkedin.com/in/craigcsellars/) |
| **Are there AT LEAST two WG members who support standardization of a DID method?** | We are looking to build interoperability and data formats standardization between MDIP and other available DID Methods |
| **Are there no trademark or IP issues?** | MDIP and the systems referenced in this document are published under an MIT License by SelfID.  |
| **What type of DID method is this?** | Decentralized |

## Is this DID method already involved in a standardization process? If so, where?

The DIF is our first attempt at interoperating and standardizing MDIP with other DID methods.

### Experimental Use Case: MDIP Authentication to online music album

This simple experimental use case is a customization of the generic auth-demo repository. 

[https://music.mdip.yourself.dev](https://music.mdip.yourself.dev)

### Use Case Proposal: Simple P2P Password Database

This use case has not been implemented. We hope to propose this project to the DIF Labs in a separate document.

Summary: We propose using MDIP's Group Vault functionality to create a collection of encrypted documents that can be shared with authorized Member users. Using the member-management functionality already provided by the MDIP auth-demo, a system owner/operator could delegate database Items and Members administration privileges to selected users.
