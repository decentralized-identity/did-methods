# DID method standardization proposals

This folder contains a list of proposed DID methods for standardization.
This is one of the activities of the DID Methods WG as described in its [Charter](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/main/Org%20documents/WG%20documents/DIF_DID_Methods_WG_Charter_v1.pdf).

These proposals should take into account the [DID method selection criteria](../selection-criteria/).

In order to propose a DID method, create a pull request to add a proposal file, based on the [`PROPOSAL-did-example.md`](./PROPOSAL-did-example.md) template.
