# DID method standardization proposal: did:iden3

This is a proposal to include `did:iden3` in the initial set of DID methods that will be standardized by the DID Methods WG.

## Description

<!--- Include a description of this DID method and rationale for standardizing it. --->
`did:iden3` is a blockchain-based DID Method that runs atop various blockchain networks including Ethereum, Polygon, Linea among others.

The DID method leverages open source Iden3 protocol and it's tools to work with different Zero-Knowledge Protocols. Iden3 project started its development back in 2018, led by Jordi Baylina, David Schwartz, and Antoni Martin, with the goal of empowering individuals with privacy and control over their personal data by creating Self-Sovereign & Privacy-Preserving Identity Protocol that could be used in the scenarios such as national voting.

Iden3 is owned by a nonprofit “0KIMS Association” and is managed as a public good. Iden3 is not owned nor controlled by Privado ID, however Privado ID actively contributes to the open-source project along with other large organizations, universities and a broad opensource community.

A few components developed by (or co-created with) Iden3 worth highlighting:

- [Circom](https://iden3.io/circom) - world most used language and compiler to create zk-SNARK circuits
- [SnarkJS](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs) - the first general-purpose zk-SNARK prover capable of running on edge devices and a tool to run trusted setup ceremonies
- [Rapidsnark](https://github.com/iden3/rapidsnark) - very fast zk-SNARK prover, which efficiently generates proofs in broad range of scenarios from client-side proving on tiny mobile devices to bulky servers with hundreds of CPU cores and terabytes of RAM
- [Baby Jubjub Elliptic Curve (BJJ)](https://docs.iden3.io/publications/pdfs/Baby-Jubjub.pdf) - elliptic curve designed to work efficiently with zk-SNARKs
- [Sparse Merkle Tree (SMT)](https://docs.iden3.io/publications/pdfs/Merkle-Tree.pdf) - a data structure that allows for efficient verification of the integrity of the data stored in the tree, including the ability to prove the absence of a key in the tree
- [JSON Web Zero-knowledge (JWZ)](https://iden3-communication.io/proposals/jwz/overview/) - method of signing and verifying authenticity of JWT payload messages using Zero-Knowledge Proofs
- [zkQuery Language](https://docs.iden3.io/protocol/querylanguage/) - first general-purpose query language for zkp-enabled credentials

Currently, Iden3 libraries have been integrated into more than 9.000 projects, some of them are mentioned in the [supporting use cases section](#supporting-use-cases).

### Privacy Preserving Aspects of the Iden3 Signature Schemes

The Iden3 Signature Schemes (BJJ + zk-SNARKs and SMT + zk-SNARKs) enable organizations and users to have a higher degree of data minimization when exchanging credential data peer-to-peer and over distributed ledger networks.

Iden3 protocol supports the following features:

- **Predicate proofs**: The Iden3 protocol supports advanced predicate proofs that allow for complex zkQueries to be made on the data without revealing the data itself. This is useful for scenarios where the data is sensitive and the user wants to prove a certain property without revealing the data itself, for example, proving that the user is over 18 years old without revealing the exact age, or proving that the user is a resident of a country not present in a sanctioned country list. Our query language supports a wide range of operations and data types, and works well with complex credential schemas (in contrast to AnonCreds).

- **Selective disclosure**: The Iden3 protocol supports selective disclosure of attributes in the credential. This allows the user to share only the required attributes with the verifier without revealing the entire credential.

  - The Iden3 approach is different from other selective disclosure schemes like SD-JWT and BBS+ in that information on credential metadata like issuing date, expiration date, revocation nonce, credential signature are not shared with the Relying Party but instead verified inside a zk circuit. This prevents the Relying Party (RP, also known as a Verifier) to uniquely identify the credential that is being used. This is not possible in other schemes where all credential metadata (with SD-JWT) or some part of it (such as the revocation status field in case of BBS+) is shared in clear text.
  - The Iden3 protocol also prevents the RP from inferring the structure and number of fields in the credential. In the case of selective disclosure, only the required attributes are shared without revealing any credential structure information. Contrast this with other schemes (such as BBS+) in which the signature that is sent during the presentation reveals the information on the number of fields to the verifier.

- **Privacy-preserving credential non-revocation proofs**: The Iden3 protocol allows the user to prove that credential is not revoked without revealing unique credential or user identifiers. This also eliminates the "Phone Home" problem where the Verifier needs to check the revocation status of the credential with the Issuer, revealing the user's activity to the Issuer.

- **Pairwise Pseudonymous Identifiers (Profiles)**: The Iden3 protocol allows the user to present different identifiers to each counterparty, and still is able to use all the credentials issued to other pseudonymous identifiers (maintaining strong cryptographic identity holder binding) without revealing to which identifier credential was issued. This helps prevent the correlation of user activities across different services.

- **zkLogin**: The Iden3 protocol supports zk authentication which allows the user to authenticate to the Verifier without revealing the user's public key. All pairwise pseudonymous identifiers are controlled by the same key (or set of keys) and through zkLogin, the user proves control over the specific identifier without revealing the keys.

- **Client-side Proving**: The Iden3 protocol utilizes client-side proving which allows the user to store personal data and efficiently generate zero-knowledge proofs on edge devices (without relying on cloud services to store data and generate zero-knowledge proofs there like in the case of AnonCreds).

- **Key Rotation**: The Iden3 protocol supports key rotation which allows the User to rotate the keys used to authenticate, and for Issuers - keys used to sign the credentials. This is important for security reasons as it allows the user to change the keys in case of a compromise.

- **OnChain Identities and Decentralized Trustless Issuance**: The Iden3 protocol allows the identity to be controlled by a Smart Contract and the user to self-issue credentials without relying on a centralized Issuer. For example the user can generate a passport credential out of their biometric passport by verifying the passport's authenticity and correctness of the credential creation using zero-knowledge circuits and then only send the zk proof and credential hash to be signed by the OnChain Issuer after the zkp verification (all without personal data leaving user's mobile device).

## Existing materials

The `did:iden3` method specification [is available here](https://github.com/iden3/did-iden3).

A few major components and libraries related to the did method are listed here:

- Credential issuance methods supported: [BJJSignature2021](https://iden3-communication.io/w3c/proofs/bjj/) and [Iden3SparseMerkleTreeProof](https://iden3-communication.io/w3c/proofs/smt/).
- [iden3comm](https://iden3-communication.io/) didcomm based communication protocol
- [Universal Resolver Driver](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver?tab=readme-ov-file#drivers)
- [Developer documentation for the Iden3 Protocol](https://docs.iden3.io/)

In addition, [Privado ID](https://docs.privado.id/) has implemented a few components utilizing the iden3 protocol which might be helpful for implementers such as the issuer node, verifier libraries, wallet SDKs, and developer tools (schema explorer, schema builder, and query builder).
